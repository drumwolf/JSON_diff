# JSON_diff
Custom JavaScript module which compares the difference between two JSON objects (or two revisions of the same JSON object, if you wish).

### Javascript Files
- [json_diff.js](https://github.com/drumwolf/JSON_diff/blob/master/json_diff.js) - the module containing all of the JS functions to compare JSON objects.  Main function is `getDiff()` and it accepts two arguments, `left` being the original version of the JSON object and `right` being the new version.
- [test_cases.js](https://github.com/drumwolf/JSON_diff/blob/master/test_cases.js) - the file which contains the test case(s) and imports the "json_diff" module.  

### Instructions
For this iteration of this project, you run `test_cases.js` in the terminal.  If you have Node installed, you can simply type `node test_cases.js`.
